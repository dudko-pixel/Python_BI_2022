__My basic UNIX utilities with use of SYS, OS, ARGPARSE and SHUTIL modules:__

**cat.py**: _it allows you to open a file_

**ls.py:** _it allows you to list all the files in a directory (with a -a flag you will be able to see even hidden files starting with a dot)_

**mkdir.py:** _it allows you to make a new directory (with a -p flag if a directory with this name already exists there will be no mistake)_

**sort.py:** _it allows you to sort lines in a file in an alphabethical order_

**wc.py:** _it allows you to count words (with a -w flag), lines (with a -l flag) and bytes (with a -c flag) or all together (with no flags)_

**rm.py:** _it allows you to remove files and directories (you can remove anything with a -r flag)_

If a script doesn't execute please don't forget to make it executable:
chmod +x script.py (replace the word script with a desirable script name)

Scripts are executed as following:
./script.py -option file (replace the word _script_ with a desirable script name, _option_ and _file_)
